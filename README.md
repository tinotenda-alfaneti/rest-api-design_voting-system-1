<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## LAB PROMPT

Ashesi wishes to develop an electronic voting system for campus elections. You have been 
contracted to design and build the backend for the system. Design a REST API which 
enables, at least, the following:
1. Registering a student as a voter.
        a. It will be necessary for new students to be registered to vote.
2. De-registering a student as a voter.
        a. A student may need to be de-registered once they leave campus.
3. Updating a registered voter’s information.
        a. A student’s year group, major or other information might change.
4. Retrieving a registered voter.
5. Creating an election.
6. Retrieving an election (with its details).
7. Deleting an election.
8. Voting in an election.

Write down all the requests your API will accept and respond to for this task. Include sample 
request body (where applicable) and response with response body (where applicable). We 
are assuming the Content-Type is application/json.
